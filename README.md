# README #

This README provides instructions and information to get your Linux utility machine up and running with the automation package to deploy Linux VMs from ISO.


### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to be used in the full deployment of Linux VMs from ISO.


### Disclaimer ###

The deployment procedure has to be the same for all deployments. Ansible code contained in this repository is to automate the standard deployment procedure. Customization for a given deployment is limited to the environment variables used during installation. Do not modify the Ansible code on the fly during installation. Ansible code is NOT meant to be touched/edited except in the context of standard deployment procedure automation development. The usage information below gives the user the needed information to set up and execute the supported automated procedures.


### Installation ###

On a newly installed Linux **CentOS 7.7+/AlmaLinux 8+/Ubuntu 22.04+** VM that has **git** and **docker**/**podman** installed and configured and that can access the internet, container repo and the VM infrastructure, run the following command to download the automation code:

1- Download the Ansible automation package

    $> git clone https://github.com/wtout/pub-labs-linux-auto.git

2- Go to the newly cloned pub-labs-linux-auto directory

    $> cd pub-labs-linux-auto

***Note**: you might need to disable the proxy to be able to clone the repository*


### System definition ###

Create your own system definition file under the _``Definitions``_ directory to contain the information defining the instance to deploy. Use the included _``build_def_info.yml``_ file as a template

***Note**: If you choose to make changes to git tracked items such as directory names or file names or content of files downloaded from the repository, be aware that your changes will be lost every time the automated installation package is updated*

The system definition file consists of the following variables:

  - **build.name** (_String_): Build Name. Required
  - **team_contact1** (_String_): Email address of the first contact
  - **team_contact2** (_String_): Email address of the second contact
  - **team_mailer** (_String_): Email address of the team
  - **build.version.os_iso** (_String_): OS ISO file name
  - **build.deployment_model** (_String_): Required. Valid values are: **a**, **h**, where **a** represents “**a**ppliance” and **h** represents “**h**osted”
  - **build.disaster_recovery** (_Boolean_ **yes**/**no**): Required. Indicates whether or not to build a geo-redundant stack
  - **build.primary.number_of_lnxvm** (Integer): Required. Number of Linux VMs in primary site. Valid values are numbers in [0-100]
  - **build.primary.name_prefix** (_String_): Required. Name prefix for primary VMs
  - **build.primary.octets** (_String_): Required. First three octets for primary VMs
  - **build.secondary.number_of_lnxvm** (_String_): Required. Number of Linux VMs in secondary site. Valid values are numbers in [0-100]
  - **build.secondary.name_prefix** (_String_): Required when disaster_recovery is “yes”. Name prefix for secondary VMs
  - **build.secondary.octets** (_String_): Required when disaster_recovery is “yes”. First three octets for secondary VMs
  - **datacenter.primary.name** (_String_): Required. Primary Datacenter name
  - **datacenter.primary.cluster** (_String_): The cluster to host the build's primary VMs
  - **datacenter.primary.folder** (_String_): The folder to host the build's primary VMs
  - **datacenter.primary.resources** (_String_): Required for on-prem deployments. List of ESXI hosts
  - **datacenter.secondary.name** (_String_): Required. Secondary Datacenter name
  - **datacenter.secondary.cluster** (_String_): The cluster to host the build's secondary (DR) VMs
  - **datacenter.secondary.folder** (_String_): The folder to host the build's secondary VMs
  - **datacenter.secondary.resources** (_String_): Required for on-prem deployments. List of ESXI hosts

To create the system inventory without deploying the system, issue the following command from the automation root directory (pub-labs-linux-auto):

    $> bash Bash/play_deploy.sh --envname <system-name> --tags none


### ISO Image ###

The tool automatically creates a symbolic link to the _``/data/Packages``_ directory in the automation directory. The _``Packages``_ link points to a _``Packages``_ directory under /data, if it exists. If it does not exist, the automation will stop with an error message. The user must ensure that the OS ISO image to be used is available on the Linux utility/deployment machine under _``/data/Packages/ISO``_ prior to starting the automated build process.

If the _``/data/Packages``_ directory does not exist, the user must create a _``Packages/ISO``_ directory in the automation directory and copy the ISO image to it prior to starting the automated build process.


### System Deployment ###

1- From the automation root directory (pub-labs-linux-auto), run one of the bash scripts under the Bash directory depending on what you want to do. 

    $> bash Bash/<script name> --envname <system-name>

with the _``system-name``_ being the name of the system definition file from "System Definition" and the script name being one of the following options:

- ``play_deploy.sh``

- ``play_rollback.sh``

  Script output is automatically saved to a log file. The file is saved under _``Logs/<script-name>.<system-name>.log.<time-stamp>``_ on the Linux utility machine

***Note**: Running multiple instances of the same script for a given build simultaneously is prohibited*

2- Answer the prompts on the CLI. If you simply hit enter, default values will be used unless an input is required. In such a case you will be prompted again to enter a value


### Tips and tricks ###

The list of roles used in the playbooks:

  - **define_inventory**: generates the system inventory from the system definition file
  - **check_creds**: validates the user's credentials
  - **todo**: determines what roles and/or tasks to execute
  - **vm_facts**: defines the individual VM facts required in the playbook
  - **capcheck**: performs a capacity check of the infrastructure
  - **infra_dns_records**: creates the DNS records for the VM
  - **vm_fromiso**: deploys the stack's VMs from ISO
  - **vm_hardening**: enables hardening on the VMS created from ISO
  - **docker**: installs and configures docker on the VMS created from ISO
  - **ldap_integration**: joins the VM to the domain to allow AD users to login
  - **usrquota**: sets user's home directory quota
  - **amp_connector**: Installs the Cisco AMP connector
  - **udesktop**: Installs and configures the XFCE desktop manager on Ubuntu

To execute specific role(s), add "_--tags 'role1,role2,etc...'_" as argument to the script.

To skip specific role(s), add "_--skip-tags 'role1,role2,etc...'_" as argument to the script.

**_Example1_**: to execute one or more roles, run the script as follows:

    $> bash Bash/<script-name> --envname <system-name> --tags 'role1,role2,etc...'

**_Example2_**: to run all roles except one or more, run the script as follows:

    $> bash Bash/<script-name> --envname <system-name> --skip-tags 'role1,role2,etc...'

To limit the processing to specific host(s) or group(s) or a combination of both, add "_--limit 'group1,host1,etc...'_" as argument to the script.

**_Example3_**: to execute role1 and role2 on the lnxvm group and drlnxvm01, run the script as follows:

    $> bash Bash/<script-name> --envname <system-name> --tags 'role1,role2' --limit 'lnxvm,drlnxvm01'

***Note**: group(s) or host(s) names specified with --limit must match the names defined in the hosts.yml file*
